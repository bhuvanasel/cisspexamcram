### What score on practice quizzes is good enough? 

The score required to pass the exam is 70%, and the questions on the actual exam are more difficult than those on the practice quiz. For that reason, I would suggest completing all the questions at the end of each chapter, aiming for a score of 85-90%. The recommendation in the official study guide is 90% for exam readiness). 

After each quiz, read the explanations of the questions you miss and do some targeted reading on those specific topics from the official study guide. Repeat the process until your practice quiz results meet the 85-90% bar. This is the "80/20 strategy" I explain in the video.

### How do I test my readiness for a specific domain?

The online resources (test bank) for the Official CISSP Study Guide allow you to create your own custom quizzes based on the questions for specific chapters in the book. For example, chapters 1-4 in the book cover exam topics in Domain 1. If you create a practice quiz of questions from chapters 1 through 4, you can assess your knowledge of Domain 1 topics.

A complete list of book chapter to exam domain mappings is shown in the figure below.

### Do the changes coming to the CAT Exam affect how I prepare?

The short answer is "no". Before June 1, 2022, the exam contains 25 pretest (unscored) items. On June 1, 2022, the exam will be expanded to include 50 pretest (unscored) items, which will increase the minimum and maximum number of items you will need to respond to from 100-150 to 125-175 items during your exam. To allow for these additional items, the maximum exam administration time will increase from three hours to four hours.
